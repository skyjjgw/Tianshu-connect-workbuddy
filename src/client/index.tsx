     * (issue #46): the mirror is filled by an async `remote.settings.describe()`,
     * so at `apply` time `view` is usually still absent. The old code read that
     * absence as "the declared name must be right", bound
     * `forms.get('workbuddy')`, and never looked again. `ConfigFormController.
     * derive()` matches the namespace EXACTLY, so the guessed form stayed
     * `unavailable` forever; the composer gate — reading only that scope —
     * judged the opt-out switch `undefined !== false` and kept rendering the
     * readout. Unticking the box wrote `false` correctly and changed nothing on
     * screen.
     *
     * `whileServed` is the Host's own idiom for this (`mirror.subscribe` plus an
     * immediate sync). It is strictly better than re-reading the snapshot by
     * hand because it ALSO withdraws the binding if the Host stops serving our
     * namespace, and it hands `register` the set of namespaces actually served
     * — so the choice is made from live data instead of a captured guess.
     *
     * `register` runs on the unserved→served EDGE, not on every mirror update
     * (see the service's `sync`), so the disposal below is not a churn loop: it
     * clears whatever a previous edge left registered. That replacement is NOT
     * optional, because the renderer caches each entry's inject result by object
     * identity (`rootInjectCache` / `cachedRootInject` in
     * `dsh-client-ui-renderer`: `if (!props) { props = runInject(...) }`), so an
     * entry registered before the mirror landed is never re-evaluated. Late
     * binding can therefore only work if the OLD registrations are disposed and
     * NEW ones created — which is what this callback does.
