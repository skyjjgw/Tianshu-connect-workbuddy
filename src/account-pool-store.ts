/**
 * The account pool's RUNTIME store: measured facts, on disk, outside settings.
 *
 * 参考：本仓库 `src/auth.ts` 的插件自有文件约定（`$DSH_HOME` 下的
 *   `.workbuddy-auth.<region>.json`，`withFileLock` + `writeFileAtomic`，
 *   `mode: 0o600`）。本模块沿用同一套写入方式与同一份隐私标准。
 * 改动：存的是**观测结果**而非凭据 —— 因此文件里不含任何 token，
 *   并且它与用户设置**分开落盘**，原因见下。
 *
 * 为什么这些事实不放 settings（`regions[region].pool`）：
 *
 *   卡片对用户偏好用的是「草稿 → 保存 → 丢弃草稿」模式：保存成功会丢弃草稿。
 *   如果探测结果也住在那个槽里，用户手工点一次「保存」就会用**几分钟前的草稿**
 *   覆盖掉定时器刚写进去的结果 —— 那等于把测量结果回退，测试白做。
 *   观测数据由插件高频写入、且不是用户偏好，所以它必须落在自己的文件里。
 *
 * 本模块的读写**从不抛异常给调用方**：池是增强功能，一个损坏的观测文件绝不能让
 * 卡片或 host 启动失败 —— 最坏情况是「回到未测试」，而不是整个插件不可用。

 * Merge ONE new measurement over the record already stored for that account.
 *
 * A plain `{ ...existing, ...update }` is wrong here, and the damage is silent.
 * The two writers describe the same account at different moments and carry
 * different fields:
 *
 *   - `test-batch` measures the TARGET MODEL deliberately, so it is the only
 *     writer that can produce a refresh point (`retryAtMs` with
 *     `retrySource: 'quota-refresh'`) — a time the billing side states outright.
 *   - `live-request` reports what a real chat request just hit. It often carries
 *     no `retryAtMs` at all (a transport blip names no time), and a spread would
 *     therefore DELETE the refresh point the probe had already resolved.
 *
 * Measured consequence of the spread, on a real `14018` account: the probe
 * recorded "quota refreshes 2026-11-01", the next live failure rewrote the
 * record without that field, and the pool then reported "retry in about 30
 * minutes" — putting an exhausted account back into rotation to be refused
 * again. The correct value was in the file one write earlier.
 *
 * So `retryAtMs` is INHERITED when the update does not state one, and every
 * other field is the update's (the newer measurement owns `outcome`, `atMs`,
 * `source` and `message`). Inheriting is only about the one field whose absence
 * is not a statement: an update that DOES carry a time still overrides, which is
 * what lets a fresh, shorter cooldown supersede a stale longer one.
 *
 * Pure and exported so the rule is unit-testable without a filesystem — this is
 * exactly the kind of "two writers, one slot" rule that this project has been
 * bitten by before.
