/**
* The two host utilities this plugin uses that must ALSO work in the
* standalone CLI (issue #47).
*
* WHY THIS EXISTS. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-atomic-write` and
* `@deepseek-ai/dsh-home-paths` are declared as **peer** dependencies: the DSH
* host carries them, and the plugin is supposed to borrow the host's copies.
* Inside a booted host that works — `packages/boot/app-boot`'s runtime
* interception layer answers those bare specifiers from the installation. But
* `（DSH 环境的旧命令形态） …` is NOT a booted host:
* `plugin-manager`'s `runProfilePnpm` spawns `pnpm exec` in the profile
* directory with the plain environment, so the child resolves with stock Node
* rules and the interception layer is absent (DSH deliberately never sets
* `NODE_PATH`; `packages/boot/app-boot/src/index.ts` scrubs it).
*
* The profile is created with `autoInstallPeers: false`, so peers are never
* installed there either. The result on a clean machine is a load-time crash
* before any command runs:
*
*   Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package
*   '@deepseek-ai/dsh-atomic-write' imported from
*   …/profiles/<p>/node_modules/<plugin>/lib/host-heartbeat-*.js
*
* The trigger is CHUNKING, which is why the import looked unrelated to the
* command: tsdown emits `host-heartbeat-*.js` as the shared chunk holding
* `auth`, `at-rest`, `host-heartbeat`, and `pi-ai-runtime`, so `lib/bin.js`
* reaches `auth.ts`'s atomic-write import even for a read-only `status`.
*
* WHY NOT a static import with a fallback: a static `import` of a missing
* package throws at MODULE EVALUATION time, before any fallback can run. The
* import itself has to be deferred, so both peers are loaded through
* `import()` inside the functions that need them.
*
* WHY NOT move them to `dependencies`: the host half genuinely runs against
* the host's copies, and duplicating them into every profile would add two
* packages to a market install to serve a CLI that runs a handful of times.
* More importantly these two are pure, stateless, cordis-free utilities — no
* service, no process-global state — so the host's copy and a local copy are
* interchangeable, which is exactly what makes a fallback safe here. (Contrast
* `@deepseek-ai/cordis` or pi-ai, where a second copy WOULD be wrong: cordis
* carries the service registry, and pi-ai's generation changes context shape.)
*
* WHY THE FALLBACK MIRRORS THE HOST. `writeFileAtomic` and `withFileLock`
* govern a cross-process protocol: the lock is a `wx`-created `<file>.lock`
* sibling and the commit is a same-directory temp file renamed over the
* target. A fallback with different timing or a different lock path would let
* a CLI process and the host race each other on the same file, so the retry
* cadence, the Windows transient-error set, and the `EPERM`-needs-`lstat`
* confirmation rule are transcribed from the host package rather than
* reinvented. `docs/WINDOWS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (2.0.x) already record the
* measured budget: delay sequence 20+40+80+160+200×4 ≈ 1100ms, not the
* "600ms" an earlier draft of the docs claimed.
*
* Inside DSH the host's own copy always wins — the dynamic import resolves it
* first, and the fallback is unreachable there. The fallback exists solely so
* the standalone CLI is self-sufficient on a machine that has only the plugin.

* a market install probed outside the host, and the caller falls back.
*
* Why ONE `catch` covers both "absent" and "broken": `import()` rejects with
* `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for the first and rethrows the module's own error for
* the second, and there is nothing this plugin could do differently about
* either — it cannot repair the host's copy. Falling back is strictly better
* than crashing, and it is not SILENT: `doctor` reports which implementation
* is in use, so a host copy that is present but unloadable shows up as
* `fallback` on a machine where the host should have supplied it. Narrowing

* WorkBuddy desktop "at-rest" credential decryption.

*
*   { "$wbEncrypted": 1, "envelope": "<base64 of a JSON envelope>" }
*
* where the envelope is `{suite, keyId, nonce, authTag, ciphertext}` for
* AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte nonce and a 16-byte tag. The authenticated
* additional data is a length-prefixed transcript over the scheme, suite,
* keyId and framing, so the ciphertext can only be opened for the exact field
* shape it was sealed for.
*
* The field key itself is NOT a user secret: it is a build-time constant
* compiled into the app's own Electron native module
* (`electron_browser_workbuddy_storage`). The app fetches it through
* `loggerGet()` and hashes the returned base64 STRING (not the decoded bytes)
* to obtain the 32-byte key; `keyId` is the first 16 hex characters of that
* key's SHA-256.
*
* This module re-derives the same key by asking the installed app for the same
* payload, and caches it in memory for the process lifetime. Nothing is ever
* written to disk, and the payload is never logged.
*

*   加密凭据**永远**取不到密钥，用户却被报成「未登录」。现在二进制名向 bundle
*   自己问（`macosBundleExecutable()`），候选含国际版 `WorkBuddy AI.app`，
*   并允许 App 被归入 applications 目录的子目录——扫到的候选必须先用
*   `CFBundleIdentifier` 确认身份才 `execFile`，因为**每个 Electron 应用的

* WorkBuddy credential resolution.
*
* 参考：corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect（MIT，Copyright (c) 2026 Corrine Hu）
*   — 桌面端 auth 文件只读、刷新结果写入 $DSH_HOME 自有副本、双凭据取
*     到期更晚者、按需刷新（5 分钟余量）与单飞去重、刷新失败但 token
*     未过期则继续沿用旧 token。这些机制已在该项目验证，此处沿用。
* 改动：原版只解析单个 `workbuddy-desktop.info`。WorkBuddy 桌面端在
*   同一 auth 目录留下带时间戳的备份文件（`workbuddy-desktop.<stamp>.info`），
*   实测这些文件各自持有不同账号的可用凭据（本机 6 个文件 → 2 个账号）。
*   本实现改为扫描整个 auth 目录，按 uin 去重为多个可选账号。跟随 App
*   当前登录（live 文件）仍是默认行为；用户显式选择的账号被严格绑定，
*   不因积分多少而切换，失效时也不会静默改选其他账号。
*   另：store 可按区域（cn | global）限定可见账号 —— 国内版与国际版各持
*   一个 store，账号、刷新、选择完全隔离；插件自有刷新副本也按区域分
*   文件（`.workbuddy-auth.<region>.json`），双账号同时在线互不覆盖，
*   旧的单文件 `.workbuddy-auth.json` 作为迁移源保留读取。
*   另（issue #15）：`resolve()` 不再把「没登录」与「有登录但凭据读不出来」
*   合并成同一句话。后者（加密字段 + 取不到密钥）改为抛
*   `WorkBuddyEncryptedCredentialError`，给出「装 App / 用
*   WORKBUDDY_APP_EXECUTABLE 指定」这条**可执行**的建议——对已登录的用户说
*   「请重新登录一次」指向的是唯一无效的动作。判定只在失败路径上跑一次
*   `diagnose()`，健康路径不付任何代价。

*
* - The scan's clock is the DESKTOP document's `lastRefreshTime` (the
*   upstream's own issuance time) — and the live file ranks above every
*   backup regardless of time, per {@link fileRank}.
* - The vault entry's clock is `refreshedAtMs`, the local write time of the
*   plugin refresh (or OAuth login) that produced it. A wall clock is not
*   comparable to an issuance time, so the two are NOT mixed: the entry is
*   replaced only when the scan's read is the live sign-in AND either the
*   entry predates the scan read's issuance, or the entry was written before
*   the plugin refreshed into it — approximated by requiring the live file's
*   issuance to be NEWER than the entry's write time.
*
* The rule's purpose is breaking the refresh loop: without it, a scan keeps
* reinstating the (older, soon-to-expire) desktop token over the refreshed
* vault copy, so every restart re-refreshes every account. With it, the
* desktop token wins only while it is genuinely newer than what the plugin
* last wrote — after that the refreshed copy is the operative credential,

	*
	* PREFERS deleting the file over writing an empty list: an absent file is the
	* normal state and keeps the vault directory free of a file that says nothing.
	* The unlink is not the only way, though, because on Windows removing a file
	* another process holds open fails with `EPERM`/`EBUSY`/`EACCES` — an antivirus
	* scanner, OneDrive, or an editor with it open, the same contention the card's

	* on exactly the platform it matters most on.
	*
	* So the unlink falls back to OVERWRITING the list with an empty one through
	* the same locked atomic write `writeDismissed` uses. For every reader the two
	* outcomes are identical (`readDismissed` yields no ids either way), so the
	* user's ask is honoured even when the file itself cannot be removed.
	*
	* Returns whether the dismissals are now genuinely gone, VERIFIED by reading
	* the list back rather than by trusting the write: the caller renders this, so
	* "it worked" has to mean it. A `false` is the honest answer for a vault that
	* could neither be unlinked nor rewritten, and the rescan still runs — the

* The `code` spelling the HOST is expected to classify each upstream failure by.

* phrases out of `type + " " + code + " " + message` — see
* `isQuotaExceededError` in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`. Only `RATE_LIMIT`, `SERVER`,
* `TIMEOUT`, `TRANSPORT` and `EMPTY_RESPONSE` are in its retry set, so the
* spelling decides which of two very different things happens next.
*
* `soft_rate` is the one kind that spelling got wrong. The upstream's 429 says
* "usage exceeds the frequency limit, and it resets at 13:37" — hours away, not
* two seconds. Sent as `soft_rate` it reads as an ordinary rate limit, enters
* the in-place retry set, and spends the whole retry budget on an endpoint that
* cannot recover within it; by the time cross-provider failover is offered, the
* turn has already failed. The upstream's own words are Chinese, so the
* phrase-based classifier cannot see the distinction either — the label is the
* only channel left to carry it.
*
* `quota_exceeded` is the minimal honest translation: it is the WORDS the host
* recognises, and it matches what the upstream is actually saying. The HTTP
* status stays 429 (that is what the upstream returned — relabelling it 402
* would misreport the upstream), and the upstream's own message is still passed
* through verbatim for a human to read.
*
* Every other kind already lands outside the retry set by its status alone
* (`hard_credit` 402 → quota, `session_dead` 401 → auth, 502/400 → other), so
* none of them is listed: a translation nobody needs is a lie waiting to drift.
*
* `policy_reject` is deliberately NOT listed either, for a sharper reason than
* the others: the obvious candidate translation would be the upstream's own
* numeric code (11140), but that is not a class the host knows, so it would take
* the host's generic path and add nothing over `policy_reject`. It needs no
* translation to stay outside the retry set (403), and it must NOT be translated
* INTO the set — a content-policy refusal is deterministic, so retrying it in
* place would spend the retry budget on a request the server will refuse again,
* and cross-provider failover cannot help a policy decision either. The code the
* host receives therefore names the class honestly.
*
* `model_busy` gets the same `quota_exceeded` translation as `soft_rate`, and
* for a sharper version of the same reason: it arrives as a 429, and the host's
* in-place retry set is exactly where a request that is about to be refused
* again must not go. A model that is loaded for everyone will not clear inside
* one turn's backoff, so spending five attempts on it delays the honest answer
* without ever producing one. `type` still says `model_busy`, which is what a

* nothing but markup, holding the bytes long enough to retry ONCE.
*
* ============================================================================
* Why this class exists rather than a `.pipe()`
* ============================================================================
*
* Recovering a call means inspecting `delta.content` before the client sees it,
* which the old `body.pipe(res)` could not do. The parsing rules live in
* `src/dsml-recovery.ts`; everything here is about the STREAM's obligations:
*
*   1. FRAME ORDER IS NEVER CHANGED. Frames are forwarded in arrival order.
*      The only frame this class invents is the trailing one that carries a
*      block still unfinished at end-of-stream.
*
*   2. HOLDS ARE TEMPORARY AND PAY FOR THEMSELVES. Nothing is held unless the
*      answer so far consists only of markup: the moment real prose or a real
*      call appears, everything held is flushed in order and the stream returns
*      to plain pass-through. An ordinary answer therefore pays no latency at
*      all, and no byte is ever discarded while a retry is still possible.
*
*   3. A RETRY MUST NOT SPLICE TWO ANSWERS TOGETHER. That constraint is why the
*      hold exists: because no content frame has been written yet, the caller
*      can discard this attempt and re-send the same body. The existing
*      failover loop makes the same promise for failures BEFORE the stream
*      starts (see its comment in `chatCompletions`); this extends it to the
*      one case that can only be recognised after the fact.
*
*   4. NOTHING IS INVENTED WHEN THE UPSTREAM ALREADY SPEAKS STRUCTURED CALLS.
*      Once a native `delta.tool_calls` appears, recovery switches off for the
*      rest of the response — two live call channels for one answer is worse
*      than either one alone.
*
*   5. EVERY FRAME LEAVES SELF-CONTAINED. An SSE event ends at a blank line,
*      and a frame written without its terminator merges into the NEXT event
*      the client decodes — whose `data:` lines are then joined and parsed as
*      one document (issue #53). Every write therefore goes through
*      {@link emitFrame}, which completes the terminator; `push()` cuts frames
*      that already carry it, and the one source of unterminated bytes — the
*      half-frame left in `carry` when the upstream dies — is normalized in
